## About Me

I am an final year student of Statistics at [the University of Science and Technology of China, School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/). My passion for uncovering patterns within randomness has driven me to explore a wide range of topics, from financial applications to statistical linguistics and high-dimensional machine learning.

I am interested in high-dimensional statistics and statistical learning. During my summer research, I explored:

-  Bagging and Boosting: Investigated their predictive properties in high-dimensional and weak-signal settings, revealing connections with ridge regression and lasso.
-  Active Learning: Studied its classification properties in high-dimensional logistic models, particularly the convergence rate of excess risk.

I am also interest in the intesection between Statistics and Economics and Linguistics. My early research experiences include designing stochastic integrals for option pricing models during an NCSU online program and studying the relationship between linguistic tones and other factors using statistical methods.

## My TA experience

Apart from my academic journey, I am passionate about sharing my ideas and experiences with others. Serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) has been one of the most rewarding ways to achieve this. Below are the courses I have contributed to as a TA:

- <span style="display: inline-block; width: 80%;">Mathematical Analysis B1</span> <span style="float: right; color: gray;">Fall 2023</span>
- <span style="display: inline-block; width: 80%;">Mathematical Analysis B2</span> <span style="float: right; color: gray;">Spring 2024</span>
- <span style="display: inline-block; width: 80%;">Regression Analysis</span> <span style="float: right; color: gray;">Fall 2024</span>
